As I'm specially interested in Statistics and Operational Research. I have collaborated in different projects related to these areas.
Here, you can find  some of them:

During the academic year 2022/2023 I'm finishing the <a href="https://www.master-mva.com">M2 Mathematics, Vision, Learning</a>,
 or in French <em> Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage </em> (MVA) at École Normale Superieure de Paris-Saclay, 
 a prestigious Machine-Learning master focused in research. Here, you can find some information about projects that 
 I've done in the master:

In this file, a report of my internship as research thanks to CITMAGA-Explora scholarship. It's my first introduction to text-mining. While its duration, 
I have studied the hyperspherical clustering through the application of EM algorithm to von Mises-Fisher distributions.

In galician language, my final B. Sc. degree in Mathematics dissertation called <b> An introduction to Modal Regression</b>. It was directed by
Rosa M. Crujeiras and Maria Alonso. It obtained the maximum qualification 10.00/10.00 and it was awarded with a prize for its language quality.
<br>
In my dissertation, I have done a bibliographic revision of multimodal regression using the mean-shift algorithm.
In the first chapter, I illustrate why mean regression is not always a good option. Then, I introduce a technichal chapter where non-parametric kernel
			regression is explained. Finally, I develop the idea of multimodal regression and I show a real data application.

The last TP (Travaux Pratiques) for the course of Computational Statistics given by Stéphanie Allassonnière for the MVA Master. Here, I implement in Python
two extensions of the Metropolis-Hastings: adaptative and multimodal.

As part of my collaboration scholarship in the department of Analysis, Statistics and Operational Research, I have analyzed the veryfication of linear regression
hypothesis in different datasets. To simplify and make more effective this task, I develop a R Code to verify these hypothesis, including collinearity,
			homocedasticity and normality.

This project was developed with a classmate of the course Advanced Programming and Projet of M1 Applied Math at ENSIIE.
			It was developed in C++ using the SDL library and its aim was to create an alphabet to show bitmaps with capital size letters.

This project was developed with two classmates of the course Complements and Tools for Operational Research  of M1 Applied Math at ENSIIE.
			It was developed in Julia and its aim was to create a column generation algorithm to solve different Cutting Stock Problems (CSP).

This small projet, in french, was done in the course Data Analysis of M1 Applied Math at ENSIIE. 
			Its aim was to reproduce the clustering algorithm of k-medoids and its results in R. 
As it is shown in the article <em>A simple and fast algorithm for K-medoids clustering</em> by Hae-Sang Park and Chi-Hyuck Jun,
			this algorithm is an alternative clustering technique very useful if we know the distance matrix.
