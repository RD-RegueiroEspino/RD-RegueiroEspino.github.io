I'm especially interested in Statistics and Operational Research. I have collaborated on different projects related to these areas.
Here, you can find some of them:

During the academic year 2022/2023 I'm finishing the <a href="https://www.master-mva.com">M2 Mathematics, Vision, Learning</a>,
 or in French <em> Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage </em> (MVA) at École Normale Superieure de Paris-Saclay, 
 a prestigious Machine-Learning master focused on research. Here, you can find some information about projects that 
 I've done in the master:

Here, you can find the results of my internship in the <a href=https://www.inria.fr/fr/tau> TAU Team</a> from INRIA. Under the supervision 
of Alessandro Leite and <a href=https://audreypoinsot.github.io/academic_website/ >Audrey Poinsot</a>, I worked on observational causal discovery through an adversarial machine learning viewpoint, 
aiming to enable partial identifiability in causal inference settings.

In this file, is a report of my internship as research thanks to the CITMAGA-Explora scholarship. It's my first introduction to text mining. While its duration, 
I have studied hyperspherical clustering through the application of the EM algorithm to von Mises-Fisher distributions.

In the Galician language, my final B. Sc. degree in Mathematics dissertation is called <b> An Introduction to Modal Regression</b>. It was directed by
Rosa M. Crujeiras and Maria Alonso. It obtained the maximum qualification of 10.00/10.00 and it was awarded with a prize for its language quality.
<br>
In my dissertation, I have done a bibliographic revision of multimodal regression using the mean-shift algorithm.
In the first chapter, I illustrate why mean regression is not always a good option. Then, I introduce a technical chapter where non-parametric kernel
 regression is explained. Finally, I developed the idea of multimodal regression and I show a real data application.

The last TP (Travaux Pratiques) for the course of Computational Statistics was given by Stéphanie Allassonnière for the MVA Master. Here, I implement in Python
two extensions of the Metropolis-Hastings: adaptative and multimodal.

As part of my collaboration scholarship in the Department of Analysis, Statistics, and Operational Research, I have analyzed the verification of linear regression
hypothesis in different datasets. To simplify and make more effective this task, I developed an R Code to verify these hypotheses, including collinearity,
 homoscedasticity and normality.

This project was developed with a classmate of the course Advanced Programming and Projet of M1 Applied Math at ENSIIE.
 It was developed in C++ using the SDL library and its aim was to create an alphabet to show bitmaps with capital size letters.

This project was developed with two classmates from the course Complements and Tools for Operational Research of M1 Applied Math at ENSIIE.
 It was developed in Julia and it aimed to create a column generation algorithm to solve different Cutting Stock Problems (CSP).

This small project, in French, was done in the course Data Analysis of M1 Applied Math at ENSIIE. 
 It aimed to reproduce the clustering algorithm of k-medoids and its results in R. 
As shown in the article <em>A simple and fast algorithm for K-medoids clustering</em> by Hae-Sang Park and Chi-Hyuck Jun,
 this algorithm is an alternative clustering technique very useful if we know the distance matrix.
