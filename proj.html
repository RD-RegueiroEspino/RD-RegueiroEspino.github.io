As I'm specially interested in Statistics and Operational Research. I have collaborated in different projects related to these areas.
Here, you can find  some of them:

In this file, a report of my internship as research thanks to CITMAGA-Explora scholarship. It's my first introduction to text-mining. While its duration, 
I have studied the hyperspherical clustering through the application of EM algorithm to von Mises-Fisher distributions.

In galician language, my final B. Sc. degree in Mathematics dissertation called <b> An introduction to Modal Regression</b>. It was directed by
Rosa M. Crujeiras and Maria Alonso. It obtained the maximum qualification 10.00/10.00 and it was awarded with a prize for its language quality.

In my dissertation, I have done a bibliographic revision of multimodal regression using the mean-shift algorithm.
In the first chapter, I illustrate why mean regression is not always a good option. Then, I introduce a technichal chapter where non-parametric kernel
			regression is explained. Finally, I develop the idea of multimodal regression and I show a real data application.
